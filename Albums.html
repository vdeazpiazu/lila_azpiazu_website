Ten of the album's fourteen tracks were recorded in just one day - 11th February, 1963. These included a mixture of stage favourites and 'Lennon-McCartney originals'. The four remaining songs had been committed to tape in 1962 having formed the B-side of their debut release and both sides of their second single. A slightly later recording of 'Love Me Do' to that previously released, was selected for the album. This version would also appear on a subsequent EP and later still on an American #1 single in 1964. <br>
The iconic front cover shot was taken at the then headquarters of EMI Limited at 20 Manchester Square in London's West End in early 1963 by Angus McBean. EMI remained in the building until 1995 before moving to West London taking the famous balcony railing with them.<br>
Given that the UK album chart in those days tended to be dominated by more 'adult' tastes such as film soundtracks and easy listening vocalists, it was a surprise when Please Please Me hit the top of the chart in May 1963 and remained there for thirty weeks before being replaced by With The Beatles. <br>">

With The Beatles carried on where Please Please Me had left off, melding more Lennon-McCartney originals with further highlights from their stage set. It also included the song-writing debut of their twenty-year old, Lead Guitarist, George Harrison.<br>
While the majority of their debut album had been completed in one day, The Beatles had to record their second release in-between other engagements that included, concert tours, numerous radio and TV performances (including the prestigious Sunday Night At The London Palladium) and their first international tour to Sweden. It was around this time that the term 'Beatlemania' was first coined and this was very much in evidence when they took part in that year's Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. If that wasn't enough they also had to write, record and promote three new 45's all of which reached the no.1 spot in the UK charts.
None of the tracks from With The Beatles was released as a single in the UK and the distinctive black and white cover shot by Robert Freeman also broke new ground for a pop album.<br>
With The Beatles shot to No. 1 in the Britain replacing Please Please Me and remained there for 21 of the 51 weeks it spent in the Top Twenty.
Like Please Please Me it didn't receive a US release until 1987 but the cover shot was used on their debut album for Capitol Records 'Meet The Beatles' - which also included nine of the tracks from the British release plus three other songs including their first US hit - 'I Want To Hold Your Hand'.<br>

data-description2="Released on 10th July, 1964, the Beatles third album in less than eighteen months was timed to coincide with the cinema opening of their first movie.
Of the album's 13 tracks seven were featured in the soundtrack of the film. One single had been released ahead of the album that being 'Can't Buy Me Love'/'You Can't Do That' which had been issued on 20thMarch. It was also quite remarkable that for the first time on a Beatles album that all of the titles had been composed by John and Paul. <br>
Since the release of With The Beatles, the previous November, their UK success had started to spread around the world. Their first US single via Capitol Records - 'I Want To Hold Your Hand'/'I Saw Her Standing There' had topped the US charts for seven weeks, leading to their former US distributor reissuing 'She Loves You' and 'Love Me Do' both of which also reached the # 1 spot. In fact such was the group's popularity that in the first week of April, 1964 they held all top five positions in the Billboard chart with a further seven titles it's Hot Hundred. <bR>
Despite their success, their workload did not ease up, in fact within hours of returning from a triumphant visit to the US, which had included concert performances and three appearances on the Ed Sullivan TV show, the guys were in a TV studio in London rehearsing and recording another guest appearance.<br>">

Beatles For Sale had been recorded on seven days scattered between August and October when their schedule was crammed with stage performances in the UK, Canada and the US and well as radio and television work. Given the lack of time it was not surprising that the group reverted to the 1963 formula of eight original songs and six covers.<br>
No single was released in the UK from Beatles For Sale - the non-album tracks 'I Feel Fine' and 'She's A Woman' performed that role - however, that coupling was followed-up in the US by 'Eight Day's A Week' (b/w ' I Don't Want To Spoil The Party') which became their 7th # 1 in March 1965.<br>
The cover portraits again taken by Robert Freeman adorned an unusual gate-fold package with the pocket containing the disc only revealed one the album sleeve was opened. There was a new author for the cover notes too - Derek Taylor. Check out his the prophetic nature of his notes penned in the autumn of 1964!<br>
The album hit the UK number one spot and retained that position for eleven of the 46 weeks that it spent in the Top Twenty.<br>">

Within days of the final February session, they were off to the Bahamas to film scenes for the movie, which like 'A Hard Day's Night' was directed by Richard Lester.<br>
On the 12th June, 1965 it was announced that The Beatles had been awarded MBE's in the Queen's birthday honours list - an accolade previously never given to young pop stars
Like A Hard Day's Night, Help! contained the songs from the film on side one of the album with the other side devoted to other new recordings including two covers. Unlike A Hard Day's Night, the two singles released prior to and alongside the album had exclusive B-sides. Help! also marked the return of George Harrison as a songwriter. George contributed one song to each side of the album.<br>
The album went immediately to no.1 in the British charts remaining there for a total of nine of its 37 weeks in the Top Twenty.<br>

Following the release of their previous album The Beatles had undertaken a momentous tour of the USA and Canada including a record breaking appearance at New York's famous Shea Stadium.<br>
Following a deserved holiday, the guys returned to the studios in mid October, not only to record the album but also a new single - their first double A-side featuring 'Day Tripper' and 'We Can Work It Out'. <br>
The album consisted of eleven songs by John and Paul, two by George and another with the unique writing credit of Lennon-McCartney-Starkey. The inclusion of a sitar on the song Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) also illustrated George's growing interest in Indian music and culture.<br>
Rubber Soul was also the last Beatles album for which Norman Smith manned the control desk. He took his leave after six albums and eleven singles going on to produce Pink Floyd and later still to enjoy success as 'Hurricane' Smith.<br>

The first recordings released from these sessions, engineered by Geoff Emerick, was the single 'Paperback Writer' and 'Rain' and those tracks gave an indication of what was to come.<br>
Having longer in the studio had paid off with greater creativity and experimentation and with John and Paul in fine form as writers. George also made his mark with three of his compositions appearing on a Beatles album for the first time.<br>
Prior to the album's release, the band had set off on a short tour of Western Germany, prior to flying to Japan then the Philippines and finally to the USA for what turned out to be their final gigs, the last of which took place on 29thAugust 1966 at Candlestick Park, San Francisco
The distinctive album sleeve design was the work of Klaus Voormann, an old friend from their Hamburg Days.<br>

Work had begun on the recording in late 1966 and at one stage it was thought that both Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever would also be included but when these were released as a single in February, that idea was abandoned.<br>
Revolver had only just been completed in time prior to the band flying off on yet another tour. Now that touring was behind them more time could be spent writing and recording. Between November 1966 and April, 1967, they spent over 400 hours in the studio - a far cry from the Please Please Me days.<br>
Of course the music was more complex and now that touring was over, there was no need to consider what could be reproduced in front of a live audience.<br>
In the studio The Beatles encouraged George Martin to achieve 'the impossible' and in turn, George and the engineers would find innovative ways of realising this despite still using only four-track equipment.

Even before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had hit the shops, the idea of the programme had been born and work had commenced on the title track.<br>
It was decided that the soundtrack for the programme would be released on two seven inch discs which would be packaged with a booklet in a gatefold sleeve. The booklet contained stills from the show along with a comic strip telling the story. A lyric sheet was also stapled into the centrespread of the booklet. The EP was a runaway success and reached no. 2 in the UK singles chart, held off the top spot by their own single... 'Hello, Goodbye'. <br>
1967 had certainly been a year of great achievement but it was also tinged with sadness. Brian Epstein, The Beatles' manager since 1961 passed away on 27th August, 1967 at the age of 32.

Following the recording of their single 'Lady Madonna' in February, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during which they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing.

                        data-description2="First issued on 26th September, 1969 Abbey Road was the final Beatles album to be recorded but not their last to be released. Let It Be, though mainly recorded in January, 1969 was finally released in May, 1970 alongside the film of the same name.<br>
Following the 'live' nature of the 'Let It Be' recordings, for Abbey Road, The Beatles returned to the North London studios to create carefully crafted recordings with ambitious musical arrangements. Interestingly, 12 of the songs that appeared on the finished album were played during the filmed rehearsals and sessions for 'Let It Be' back in January.<br>
For the first time on a Beatles album, the front cover contained neither the group's name nor the album title just that iconic photograph taken on the zebra crossing near the entrance to the studios in London NW8 in August 1969.

Rehearsals and recording sessions for the album had taken place in January, 1969 first At Twickenham Film Studios and later in the basement and on the roof of their Apple headquarters in London's Savile Row.<br>
A single comprising of 'Get Back' and 'Don't Let Me Down' was released in April, 1969 but as The Beatles focussed their energies on a new album mainly recorded at Abbey Road, The 'Get Back' album as it was then called remained unreleased.
